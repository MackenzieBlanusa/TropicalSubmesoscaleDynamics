# TropicalSubmesoscaleDynamics

This repository holds all code relevant to the JGR: Oceans submission titled "Tropical Submesoscale Dynamics as Inferred from a Saildrone Array in the EUREC4A / ATOMIC Campaign."

Specifically, in the utlities folder, you will python scripts containing functions for calculating velocity gradients, spectral analaysis, and identifying submesoscale fronts. The notebooks folder contains jupyter notebooks for all analyses. These incldue: 

The primary data used in all analyses are saildrone data from the EUREC4A / ATOMIC campaign, which can be accessed via PO.DAAC (*insert link to SD data*)
